Tools are provided to assist with development of photochemical grid model inputs and process outputs to support permit related programs.

The tools in the PSD directory are focused on PSD related permit assessments for O3 and secondary PM2.5. The tools in the NNSR directory are related to inter-precursor trading related demonstrations. Some of the tools are the similar (or same) in the PSD and NNSR directories, but have been included in each so that both types of demonstrations have a full compliment of tools in one area and sometimes there may be small but important differences in how the tools are applied for these different purposes.
